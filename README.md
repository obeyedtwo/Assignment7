# Fundamentals of Web Development, 2nd Edition
### Chapter 13 [PHP 3], Project 2 [Travel]
This exercise builds on the last one by improving the design to be more modular and
less coupled. In particular we will guide you on separating the Location out from
the TravelPhoto class. The files from Project 1 will be used as a starting point for
this project.

**Note: The reference to travel-image.php in step 4 should be to detail.php.**
